You'll be using customer transaction history, engagement metrics, and support ticket data to identify at-risk customers and improve marketing targeting. You're aiming for at least a 5% churn reduction and improved customer satisfaction. You currently have this designed to run on AWS SageMaker, but want to use Google Cloud instead. Let's refine that and look at Google Cloud options. What specific parts of the AWS stack are you planning to use with SageMaker? This will help me understand your needs and recommend the best Google Cloud alternatives.\\n\""
